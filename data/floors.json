Beneath the murk, serpents coil unseen, crocodiles drift like shadows, and unseen creatures disturb the surface with sudden, violent splashes.",
  "The water never truly dries. Boots remain soaked, footing slips without warning, and the chill seeps through metal and cloth until stamina drains as surely as HP. Players who linger too long find their movements sluggish, their reactions dulled by the relentless cold.",
  "Rising from the flooded expanse stands the Slime Caverns, a stone structure emerging from the swamp like a monument to decay. It looms in the fog from nearly every direction, its entrance the only promise of progress — and the source of the swamp’s corruption.",
  "Within the cavern’s slick, twisting corridors, moisture drips endlessly from the ceiling as giant snails gather in flooded chambers. At the center waits Lord Slug, grotesque sovereign of stagnation. His presence thickens the very water around him, turning the swamp itself into a weapon. Floor 3 is not conquered through haste or bravery alone — it is endured. And those who cannot withstand the cold, the wet, and the weight of the mire will simply disappear beneath it."

Within waits Stallord, a colossal demon whose hardened skull gleams like obsidian under the sun. It is said that during battle, the storm answers his call — and the sands themselves begin to move.",
    "Floor 4 tests endurance more than bravery. The heat drains stamina, the terrain slows movement, and the constant glare disorients even veteran fighters. Only those who adapt — and who learn to read the desert rather than fight it — will survive long enough to challenge its ruler."
